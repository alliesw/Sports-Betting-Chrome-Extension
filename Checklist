[ ] No "Place Bet" Buttons: Do not include links that automatically add items to a betslip or execute trades. The extension must remain a "read-only" dashboard.

[ ] Host Permission Scope: Ensure your manifest.json only requests access to fanduel.com and kalshi.com. Requesting *://*/* (all sites) will trigger a manual review that can take weeks.

[ ] Brand Neutrality: Your extension name cannot be "FanDuel & Kalshi Real-Time Stats." Use something like "Sports Probability Bridge" to avoid trademark infringement.

[ ] Two-Step Verification: Google now requires 2FA to be enabled on your developer account before you can publish.

[ ] "Single Purpose" Rule: Your extension must do one thing well. Don't add a "Weather Widget" or "Stock Tracker" to a betting tool.

2. Privacy Policy Template

You are required to host a privacy policy on a public URL (like a GitHub Page or a simple website). Because you are handling API Keys and Betting Data, you must use "Sensitive Data" disclosures.

Privacy Policy for [Extension Name]

1. Data Collection: This extension collects User-Provided API Keys for Kalshi to authenticate market data. It scrapes publicly visible odds from FanDuel only when the user is actively navigating those pages.

2. Data Usage: All data is processed locally on the user's machine. API Keys are stored using chrome.storage.session and are never transmitted to our servers.

3. Third-Party Sharing: We do not sell, trade, or rent user data to third parties. Data is only exchanged between the user's browser and the official APIs of FanDuel/Kalshi.

4. Financial Disclosure: This tool is for informational purposes only. We do not facilitate financial transactions, nor do we have access to your betting wallets or bank accounts.

3. Chrome Web Store Listing Assets

To pass the "Quality" check, you need professional-looking assets.

Asset	Size	Requirement
Icon	128x128 px	High-res PNG with transparent background.
Screenshots	1280x800 px	At least two. One showing the overlay on FanDuel.
Promo Tile	440x280 px	This is what users see in search results. Keep text minimal.
4. Final Deployment Steps

Zip your project: Ensure you don't include .git folders or node_modules.

Pay the Fee: If this is your first extension, there is a one-time $5 USD developer fee.

Test Instructions: In the "Privacy" tab of the dashboard, you must provide a test API key for the Google reviewers to see how the Kalshi integration works, or they will reject it for "hidden functionality."
