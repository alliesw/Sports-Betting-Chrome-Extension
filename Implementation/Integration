2. Integrating Kalshi (Real-Time Markets)
Kalshi is developer-friendly and provides a robust WebSocket API for sub-second price updates.

API Endpoint: wss://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/stream (This endpoint handles all markets, not just elections).

Authentication: You will need an API Key and Secret from the Kalshi Developer Portal.

Implementation: 1. Initiate a WebSocket connection in your background.js. 2. Subscribe to specific market tickers (e.g., FED-2026-01-28). 3. Listen for orderbook_delta or ticker events.

3. Integrating FanDuel (Sports Stats)
FanDuel does not have a public API for individual developers. You have two main paths:

Option A: Third-Party Data Providers (Recommended)

Using a middleman service like SportsData.io or The Odds API is the most reliable way to get live scores and odds without getting banned for scraping.

Pros: Legal, stable JSON format, real-time.

Cons: Often requires a monthly subscription fee.

Option B: DOM Scraping (The "Hacker" Way)

If you want to pull data directly from the page the user is viewing:

Content Script: Use MutationObserver to watch for changes in the FanDuel DOM (e.g., price shifts in the betslip).

Logic: ```javascript const observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) => { const odds = document.querySelector('.some-fanduel-class').innerText; chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'UPDATE_STATS', data: odds }); }); observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true });

Risk: FanDuel frequently changes its CSS classes to break scrapers.

4. Technical Setup (Manifest v3)
Create a manifest.json to give your extension the necessary "eyes" and "ears."
